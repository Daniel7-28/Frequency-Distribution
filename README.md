# Description
The goal is to estimate the time each strategy takes for different data set sizes. Data sets for the experiments consist of randomly generated integers. For each size n, the experiment is conducted several times: generate a new data set of that size consisting of randomly generated integers in the range 1..n/2, apply each strategy, measure the time each strategy take, compute the final average for each strategy, set that average as the time each strategy takes to solve the problem for a data set of that size. At the end, the system should produce, for each strategy, a table relating size and time from the results produced by the system.
